# 🛡️ Privacy Guardian

**Privacy Guardian** is a community-driven, on-device privacy firewall designed to block unauthorized access to personal data — including mic, camera, and storage — across all apps and platforms. Inspired by antivirus software, it works offline, protects user data in real-time, and only sends necessary information with your permission.
