# 🛡️ Privacy Guardian

> **“Antivirus protects your device. Privacy Guardian protects *you*.
> AI-proof. Leak-proof. Privacy-first.”**

**Privacy Guardian** is a privacy-first, on-device tool that works like an antivirus — but for your personal data. It blocks unauthorized access to your mic, camera, and sensitive information. Core features run entirely offline, with optional hybrid updates.
