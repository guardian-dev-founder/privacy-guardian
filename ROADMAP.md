# 🛣️ Privacy Guardian – Project Roadmap

> **“Antivirus protects your device. Privacy Guardian protects *you*. AI-proof. Leak-proof. Privacy-first.”**

This roadmap outlines the planned features, development stages, and contribution goals for **Privacy Guardian** — a privacy-first tool that works like an antivirus for your personal data.

---

## 🎯 Mission

To build an on-device, community-powered privacy tool that:
- Blocks unauthorized mic, camera, and data access  
- Works fully offline for core operations  
- Alerts users in real time  
- Never leaks or uploads personal data  
- Uses a **hybrid model** only for rule/definition updates — no personal data is ever sent  

---

## 🧩 Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Mic & Camera kill-switch  
- Real-time data access alerts  
- Manual privacy control dashboard  
- Fully offline: no data sent outside  
- Basic local rule engine (like virus definitions)  

---

### 🚧 Phase 2: Smart Privacy Guard
- Detect apps trying to access/transfer PII (personal data)  
- Contextual permission triggers (e.g., allow mic only when voice search is used)  
- Local bug/issue scanning logic  

---

### 🌍 Phase 3: Community Contribution System
- Let developers suggest rule/code updates (pull requests)  
- Hybrid control model: all contributions reviewed before being merged  
- Non-invasive update delivery for rule engine (via hybrid update mechanism)  

---

### 🔌 Phase 4: Integrations & Expansion
- Browser extensions (Brave, Firefox, Chrome)  
- API/SDK for third-party app integration  
- OS-specific versions (Android/Linux first, then others)

## 🗓️ Timeline (Flexible)

This timeline is a rough guide and **may evolve depending on community involvement, available resources, and overall progress**.

We aim to move in stages:
- Planning and community building  
- MVP development  
- Testing and improvements  
- Integrations and scaling  

Progress and updates will be tracked through this GitHub repository.
